# recursive-image

A small Haskell webapp to create recursive images using threepenny-gui for the frontend and hip to modify the images.
Loading and saving is a bit cumbersome but it works.

To load the default image click on "draw".
to load your own image use the file input and then click on "load image".
You can use the input field to set the depth of recursion.
